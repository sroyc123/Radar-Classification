Investigate Data
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

This code loads the color correction dataset.
load trData.mat
The dataset was created from photos such as dog.jpg. Load and display this unprocessed image.
img = imread('dog.jpg');
imshow(img)

Task 1
Get the list of files
trainfiles = trainingData.File;

Task 2
Get first altered image
fn = trainfiles{1};

Task 3
Read and display image
im = imread(fn);
imshow(im)

Task 4
Get datastore of subset of images
imds = imageDatastore(trainfiles(1:9));

Task 5
View montage
montage(imds)

Task 6
Get subset of data
subsetData = trainingData(1:9,:)



Modify Network for Regression
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

Task 1
Load AlexNet and get layers
net = alexnet;
layers = net.Layers;



Task 2
Remove last three layers


layers(end-2:end) = [];

Task 3
Create array of new layers


newlayers = [fullyConnectedLayer(3); regressionLayer()];

Task 4
Add new regression layers
layers = [layers;newlayers]



Use Color Corrector
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

This code loads a network trained on the color correction data.
load colorcastnet.mat

Task 1
Load and display a test image
catim = imread('cat.jpg');
imshow(catim)

Task 2
Resize image
testim = imresize(catim,[227 227]);
imshow(testim)

Task 3
Predict test images
predrgb = predict(ccnet,testim)

Task 4
Use output

fixedim = correctColor(catim,predrgb);

Task 5
Show fixed image

imshow(fixedim)

This function modifies an input image using a vector of 3 RGB values.
function fixedim = correctColor(im,rgb)
    fixedim = uint8(single(im) - reshape(rgb,[1 1 3]));
end



Evaluate Color Corrector
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

This code loads a trained network and the testing data.
load colorcastnet.mat
load tsData.mat

Task 1
Predict test images
predrgb = predict(ccnet,testData)



Task 2
Get actual values
testrgb = testData.Color



Task 3
Calculate difference
err = testrgb - predrgb



Task 4
Calculate RMSE
squares = err.^2
rmse = sqrt(mean(squares))
